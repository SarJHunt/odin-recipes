<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using simple storecupboard and freezer ingredients, this pea and chorizo risotto makes an easy midweek meal. Garnish with crisped chorizo and grated parmesan.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>200g chorizo, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>300g arborio risotto rice</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vinegar (white wine vinegar if you have it)</li>
    <li>1.2l chicken stock (fresh is best), heated until simmering</li>
    <li>200g frozen peas</li>
    <li>60g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, tip in the chorizo and fry until it is crisp and all the oil has been released. Remove a quarter of the chorizo with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
    <li>Tip the rice into the pan, stir to coat it in the oil and toast for a min or so, then pour in the vinegar. Once the vinegar has evaporated, add a ladleful of the stock, stir then, once absorbed, add a bit more. Continue doing this for about 20 mins until most of the stock has been absorbed and the rice has swollen but still has a slight bite.</li>
    <li>Tip in the peas, parmesan and the remaining stock. Give everything a good stir. Once the cheese has melted, season with black pepper, then divide between bowls, topping each portion with the remaining crisp chorizo and extra grated parmesan.</li>
</ol>
